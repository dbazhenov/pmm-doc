.. _PMM-annotation:

:ref:`PMM annotation <PMM-annotation>`

   A feature of |pmm-server| which adds a special mark to all
   dashboards and signifies an important event in your

      |pmm-server| should keep ports 80 or 443 ports open for
      computers where |pmm-client| is installed to access the |pmm|
      web interface.

         and makes it available to |qan|.
      42002
         For |pmm| to collect |mysql| server metrics.
      42003
